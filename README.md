# Group Buy Project

### üìå Overview

Group Buy Project is a Spring Boot-based backend system designed to support group-buying business scenarios. It provides core capabilities such as discount calculation, group-buy settlement, payment callback handling, and message distribution.
The project follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) layered architecture to achieve clear separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.

### üöÄ Key Features
 

* High-Concurrency Idempotency: Redis-based distributed locks to prevent duplicate settlement execution.

* Asynchronous Decoupling: RabbitMQ (topic mode) for decoupling payment service, service and group-buy services.

* Pluggable Rule Engine: Flexible settlement rule chain with dynamic extension support.

* Engineering Practices: Multi-module Maven project with unified exception handling and configuration management.

| UC4: Place Group-buy Order                    | FR4.1: The system must lock the group-buy order first when placing group-buy order                                                                                                             |
